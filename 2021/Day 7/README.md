## Day 7: The Treachery of Whales
Here I had to freshen up some of my Math skills, the first part was alright; find the median and the absolute values of the difference between each number. 
As I'm learning Kotlin alongside these puzzles, I implemented mergesort, rather than using the built-in sorting functions. 

The second part was a bit trickier, I tried finding the increasing fuel consumage recursively, but after encountering a StackOverflowError, I tried to see if there was 
a particular sequence in the numbers listed (spoiler: it was). The forumla n(n + 1) / 2 came in handy. 

While trying to recognise this formula and searching around for it, I read (and also remembered being told) that Carl Freidrich Gauss showcased this formula in 
elementary school as a seven year old (!), upon his teacher giving him a difficult challenge.
